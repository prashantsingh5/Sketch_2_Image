# Sketch_2_image ðŸŒŸ

A deep learning project to transform sketch images into realistic images using the Pix2Pix model. This project is based on the Pix2Pix GAN architecture and uses the `pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix` framework for training and testing.

## Overview
This project aims to convert hand-drawn sketches into realistic images by training a Pix2Pix model on a custom dataset of room images. The workflow includes:
1. Preparing a dataset of real images and corresponding sketches.
2. Training the Pix2Pix model.
3. Testing the model on unseen sketches to generate realistic images.

---

## Features
- **Custom Dataset Creation**: Converts real images into sketches and prepares a Pix2Pix-compatible dataset.
- **Training Workflow**: Supports training the Pix2Pix model on custom datasets.
- **Realistic Image Generation**: Predicts realistic images from unseen sketches.
- **Automated Testing Pipeline**: Simplifies testing and output management.

## Installation

1. **clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/prashantsingh5/Sketch_2_image.git
   ```

2. **Move to pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix**:
   ```bash
   cd pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix
   ```

3. **Install Dependency**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
---

## Usage

1. **Prepare the dataset**:
   In base folder add a new datset folder with the given structure

  ```plaintext
dataset/                     
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ subfolder/                      
    â”œâ”€â”€ img1.jpg         
    â”œâ”€â”€ img2.jpg          

```

2. In the base folder **Move to script**:
   ```bash
   cd script
   ```

3. **Update the path inside process_dataset.py**:
   - base_folder = r'update with the path of base_code'
   - pytorch_folder = r'update with the path of base_code\pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix'
  
4. **Run process_dataset.py**:
   ```bash
   python process_dataset.py
   ```

      This code is creating 2 new folders:
      - **dataset_Sketch**: - This folder has sketch images.
      - **dataset_for_pix2pix**: - This folder has the necessary structure for pix2pix.

5. **Run sketch2image_model_train.ipynb**:
   - Run all the cells in sketch2image_model_train.ipynb file that will generate a best model that is further used for sketch to image conversion
   - After sucessfully running all the cells this will generate the best model.
  
6. **From the base directory move to pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix**:
   ```bash
   cd pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix
   ```
   
7. **Run test_sketch_to_image.py file**:
   ```bash
   python test_sketch_to_image.py
   ```

8. **The above file will return the output real image in new folder named "output_images". The output folder is inside  pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix.**
